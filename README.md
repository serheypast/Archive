# Archive

This app is designed to provide access to the archive with dossiers using client-server architecture and and also providing REST interface.

# Task:
create a client-server application "Archive";

archive is a catalog of personal files per person (fio, contact Information, place and work experience, etc.);

The archive is on the server;

the client GUI implementation should use one of the following libraries: Swing / SWT / JavaFX;

Each client has a set of roles;

there are three roles (you can associate the role == level of rights): to view, To change, to create and delete a case;

provide for the presence of an "administrator" client, which can Change the rights / roles of existing customers / users;

use sockets to implement a network connection;

client request and server response are sent in serialized form;

The format of storing personal files on the server - xml-files;

In the protection of laboratory work, the process of building and running an application Produce from the console (not from under the IDE);

the administrator must be able to specify the type of parser on the Server side: SAX, StAX, DOM;

the server performs an analysis of the xml-document (for example, coming from Administrator "to create a case") by the corresponding kind of parser and sends User response in the form of a collection of objects;

when retrieving information, the client restores the data by deserializing it and Outputs;

for the validation of the xml-file, it is necessary to develop an appropriate xsd-scheme (When developing an xsd schema, it is mandatory to use the ID type, simple and complex types, Transfers);

Another additional server-side parser: JDOM;

before saving personal files, organize their compression (archiving);

provide a REST interface for viewing personal files.
